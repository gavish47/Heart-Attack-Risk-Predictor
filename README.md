No problem! Since hosting is not done yet, I'll modify the **README.md** to focus only on local setup and remove the deployment sections for now. Once you successfully deploy it, we can update it with hosting details.

### **Updated README.md (Without Hosting Instructions)**

# 🏥 Heart Attack Risk Predictor  

This project predicts the **risk level of a heart attack** based on user inputs like **age, chest pain level, smoking habits, drinking habits, and stress levels**. The model is built using **Random Forest in R** and is served as an API, while the frontend is developed using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This project is only for **educational purposes**. It is **not** a medically approved diagnostic tool. Always consult a healthcare professional for medical advice.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Backend API:** R (Plumber framework)  
- **Model:** Random Forest (Trained using `caret` and `randomForest` packages)
